# Android Tweaks

While OMNT should work without changes on the phone settings needed there are some options usefull to set for better measurement results.

## Developer Settings
The following settings can be found in the android developer settings menue. On Vanilla Android devices they are enabled by going to ```Settings -> About the phone``` and pressing there multiple times ```Build number```. If this is not working on your device a quick websearch with your phone name and ```developer settings``` should help. After enabeling the developer settings they are usually accessible via ```Settings -> System -> Developer Options```.
* USB debugging: Install and debug apps via ADB
* Mobile data always active: Allows to gather mobile network information even if connected to WiFi
* Force full GNSS measurements: might improve GNSS accuracy while logging

Depending on your phone there might be more useful options (or less)
