# Special Codes View

This view, if carrier permissions are granted, allows to send so called Secret or Special Codes via the dialer API. Those codes are mostly vendor specific or even device specific and either enable hidden features or open developer menues. If carrier permissions are not granted those codes can also be entered into the system dialer. Some vendors e.g. Samsung don't allow this in there custom dialer but its usualy possible to install the google dialer from playstore and make this the default dialer.
